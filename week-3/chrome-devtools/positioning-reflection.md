##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can basically click into any element in the DOM and both view all of the CSS styles that are being applied, as well as edit them directly to  adjust any of the formatting or positioning. It immediately shows you the changes, so is far better for experimentation that making changes in sublime, saving and refreshing your browser.
##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can simply adjust the heighth and width by clicking into the properties and changing the associated values. Consider using % or em's to change them to values which will be responsive to screen size.
#What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static - this is the default positioning. It basically lays out elements as they appear top to bottom and left to right as they're read in the HTML and interpretted in the DOM.
Relative -
Absolute -
Fixed - this is the most "restrictive" positioning, and the element is basically anchored to the viewport of the user's browser, meaning it's visual position will not change whether or not a user scrolls. It's very useful for a header that you want to "float" at the top of the page as a users scrolls down.
##What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin -
Border -
Padding -
##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
Overall I thought it was a fun challenge. Definitely reinforced that learning CSS is all about trial and error, but it was way faster experimenting with things using DevTools than just with Sublime, which I'd been doing previously.
