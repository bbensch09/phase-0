What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  - We used sections & articles pretty regularly, as well as p's and h1's. I've also tended to still use a lot of Div's, because they are so versatile, but I'm trying to force myself to fit things into a section or article when appropriate. We also used the nav, footer and header, which I think are just universally necesary elements that any site shoudl have.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  - They get laid out by default top to bottom and left to right, but the browser will also display them in more or less any layout you tell it to using CSS, which we're now digging into this week.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
 - I learned how to make snippits in Sublime, which is nice to know. So far instead of using snippets and starting with a blank file, I've typically just been copying an existing file and modifying it, but a core snippet that includes your basic html structure, css file and reference, etc., I think would make even more sense. Though I'm not sure snippet's will work on more than one file at a time, so that might just be why frameworks like rails exist, because I know it will create a whole directory for you including the css and javascript files as well as your index.html file. Another sublime shortcut I've researched is the "Cmnd + /", which turns any line or highlighted text into a comment, which is very useful!
