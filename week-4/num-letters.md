##What does puts do?
  Puts prints the final output of the program to the console, but does not return anything. It stand for put "string".
##What is an integer? What is a float?
  An integer is a postive or negative whole number (i.e. -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3)
##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  Integer division is when the quotient is rounded down to it's closest integer, meaning that remainders are not kept, nor is the result allowed to include any decimals, since the output must be an integer. Float division is what we would consider normal arithmetic, and preserves the exact specificity of the numbers (i.e. 10/3 = 3.3333 in float division, but = 3 using integer division.)
