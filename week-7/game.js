 // Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description: The prisoner wants to guess the guards secret number, which is a number between 1 and 10. If he does, he'll be able to escape. With each guess, the guard will say higher, lower, or correct. After 3 guesses the guard chooses a new secret number. The prison has one chance to beg, which earns him a 4th guess. He can only beg once per game.
// Overall mission: Escape from prison!
// Goals: Guess the guard's password before it changes.
// Characters: Guard, prisoner
// Objects: Guard, Prisoner
// Functions: Guess, Create Names, Beg (optional)

// Pseudocode
//create Guard object; has attributes of name and secret number, which contains a counter property
//create Prisoner object; has attributes of name, status
//create Guess function which takes an input of integer, compares it to the secret number and updates both the secret number's counter and the prisoners status
//create Beg function, which allows the prisoner to speak his plea, and then enter one more guess
//

// Initial Code
var Guard = {
  name: "Guard";
