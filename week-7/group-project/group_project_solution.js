/*
As a user, I will be want to be creating a basic statistics calculator that has a number of standard functions. To Test these functions, I will use the two example arrays above, where one has an odd number of elements, and the other has an even number of elements.

Story #1: As a user, I will want a function called "sum" that is able to calculate the sum of an array.

Story #2: As a user, I will want a function called "mean" that is able to calculate the mean average of an array.

Story #3: As a user, I will want a function called "median" that is able to calculate the median of an array.
